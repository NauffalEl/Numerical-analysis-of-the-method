# Numerical Analysis of Methods

This document provides a brief overview of various numerical methods used for solving equations and approximating solutions.

## Methods Overview

### 1. Lagrange Interpolation
Lagrange interpolation is a polynomial interpolation technique used to approximate functions based on given data points.

### 2. Newton's Method
Newton's method is an iterative approach for finding successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.

### 3. Fixed-Point Iteration
Fixed-point iteration is a numerical method used to solve equations of the form x = g(x) by iterating from an initial guess until convergence.

### 4. Newton-Raphson Method
An improved version of Newton's method that efficiently finds roots of differentiable functions using tangent line approximations.

### 5. Newton-Raphson v2
A variant of the Newton-Raphson method with modifications to improve convergence or stability in certain cases.

### 6. Secant Method (2 Iterations)
A root-finding method that approximates derivatives using two previous points instead of requiring an explicit derivative function.

### 7. Jacobi Method
An iterative algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations, particularly useful for large sparse matrices.

### 8. Gauss-Seidel Method
An improvement over the Jacobi method that accelerates convergence by using updated values immediately within the iteration process.

These methods are fundamental in numerical analysis and play a crucial role in computational mathematics and engineering applications.
